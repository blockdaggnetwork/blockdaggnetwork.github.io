              ROADMAP
            </h2>
            <p>Build the Future with BDAG coins</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                1. Launch Phase: Crypto Presale and Foundation Setting - Set and
                publicize the initial valuation of BDAG. Develop and deploy the
                BDAG smart contract. Conduct a thorough audit of the BDAG coin.
                Initiate targeted marketing campaigns across digital platforms
                to attract global investors. Roll out a 10% bonus referral
                scheme.
              </li>
              <li>
                2. Development Phase: Presale Growth and Mainnet Planning -
                Maintain momentum in the presale, paralleled with beginning
                Mainnet development. Start production of BDAG-optimized mining
                hardware and mobile app development. Form strategic alliances
                with tech providers for cutting-edge mining solutions. Perform
                detailed market research to form a strategy and stay ahead of
                trends. Regularly update the BDAG community on progress for
                transparency and trust-building.
              </li>
              <li>
                3. Pre-Launch Phase: Presale Momentum and Mainnet Refinement -
                Keep up the presale drive, securing continuous investments.
                Dedicate efforts to Mainnet development, focusing on extensive
                testing for reliability. Select early adopters for Mainnet beta
                testing, collecting constructive feedback. Set up a responsive
                technical support team for community assistance. Enhance
                security measures for robust network protection. Conduct online
                workshops and training sessions for miners and users in
                preparation for Mainnet.
              </li>
              <li>
                4. Final Phase: Closing Presale and Mainnet Launch - Conclude
                the presale, finalizing the investment batch. Complete final
                adjustments to the Mainnet for its official release. Prepare for
                broad-scale mining operations. Release mining software,
                equipment, and user guides for immediate post-launch mining.
                Promote the availability of the BDAG mobile app. Continue
                offering the 10% earnings code for mining hardware purchases.
